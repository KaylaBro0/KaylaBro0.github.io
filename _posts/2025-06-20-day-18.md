what_i_learned: |
  Today I spent a lot of time coding and trying to get both the Rainbow DQN and Noisy DQN models to work.  
  The goal is to compare them and see which one performs better with our data. It’s been a bit of a challenge  
  figuring out how everything connects, but I’m learning more each time I dig into the code.

  We also worked on our weekly video recap. This time it was a bit frustrating because we had to record it  
  a couple times due to an audio issue. It definitely took longer than expected.

blockers: |
  I had trouble getting the video to work because of repeated audio issues.  
  I also struggled with understanding parts of the model code and getting it to run properly.

reflection: |
  Today had a few technical bumps, but I’m still glad we pushed through. Debugging both video and code at the same time wasn’t easy,
  but I know this kind of problem solving is part of the process. Hoping next week I can make more progress on the models!
