what_i_learned: |
  Today was a busy and productive day. I focused on cleaning the data, organizing it for analysis, and creating graphs to help visualize key 
  patterns. I also worked with different sets of data tied to various comorbidities, which meant diving into the specifics of each condition. A 
  big part of the day involved researching what each comorbidity actually means and how it connects to our project goals. That deeper 
  understanding helped me decide which variables were most relevant to highlight in the graphs and which conditions might be worth focusing on. 
  We came up with several questions along the way and worked through them to guide our analysis more effectively. We also played with more AI 
  sites. We had to basically disect our data to get specific things we need.It was a little interesting to see and do.

  No blockers for today.


reflection: |
   At first, sorting through all the data and trying to understand the different comorbidities espesialy hypertension was a bit overwhelming. 
   But as we started cleaning the datasets and making visualizations, things began to click. The research helped me connect the dots between the 
   raw data and the bigger picture of our project. Understanding the context behind each variable made the graphs more meaningful and guided how 
   we interpreted the results. Iâ€™m feeling more confident about moving forward and excited to keep applying what Iâ€™ve learned.
