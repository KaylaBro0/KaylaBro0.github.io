what_i_learned: |
  Today was a busy and productive day. I focused on cleaning the data, organizing it for analysis, and creating graphs to help visualize key 
  patterns. I also worked with different sets of data tied to various comorbidities, which meant diving into the specifics of each condition. A 
  big part of the day involved researching what each comorbidity actually means and how it connects to our project goals. That deeper 
  understanding helped me decide which variables were most relevant to highlight in the graphs and which conditions might be worth focusing on. 
  We came up with several questions along the way and worked through them to guide our analysis more effectively. We also played with more AI 
  sites.

  No blockers for today.


reflection: |
   At first, sorting through all the data and trying to understand the different comorbidities was a bit overwhelming. But as I started cleaning 
   the datasets and making visualizations, things began to click. The research helped me connect the dots between the raw data and the bigger 
   picture of our project. Understanding the context behind each variable made the graphs more meaningful and guided how I interpreted the 
   results. Iâ€™m feeling more confident about moving forward and excited to keep applying what Iâ€™ve learned.
