  what_i_learned: |
    Today was a great day. First, some of my favorite artists are dropping tonight, so the vibes are already high. But more importantly after
    like a million years, 2 Marvel movies, and a Tyler, the Creator album, I finally got my Rainbow DQN model to work really well. I hit around 
    80% accuracy for glucose and 78% for blood pressure using all of the features I’ve been working so hard to incorporate. It felt so good to 
    see those numbers.

    Honestly, none today just wins!

  reflection: |
    This has been one of the most satisfying days of the whole project. Even though we may end up scrapping the Rainbow model due to time 
    constraints, I’m still so proud I got it working. All the debugging, restarting, and struggling was worth it just to prove I could do it. 
    I’m ending today with a huge sense of relief, accomplishment, and some good music to celebrate.
