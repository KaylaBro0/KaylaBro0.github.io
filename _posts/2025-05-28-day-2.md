what_i_learned: |
  I started working on this website since I just got it up and running. I changed the photo, and also the facts about me. I also edited my hobbies whit things i love to do. 

  With the python 102 workshop, I reviewed dictionaries and sets. I also coded my own mini vinyl store. I made a dict, added a key and val, deleted a key and val, and edited one. I incorporated somthing I love with work.
blockers: |
 I was stuck on how to get the website up and working, but thanks to a peer I got it all figured out!
reflection: |
 Seeing growth just in one day was really exciting to see. I also got to speak with my mentor and project lead. They seem really cool and I cant wait to meet them in person next week! We played a game of headbandz which was pretty fun as well!
