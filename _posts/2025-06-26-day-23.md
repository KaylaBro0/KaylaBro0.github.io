what_i_learned: |
 I’m still working on the Rainbow DQN model, but today I started tailoring it more to fit my specific project. Originally, I was mostly using  
 glucose and BMI, but now I’m adding more health indicators like creatinine, potassium, sodium, and GPT along with glucose. This should give  
 the model more information to learn from and hopefully improve performance. Adjusting the input features takes a bit of reworking, but it’s 
  helping me better understand how the model processes different types of data.

blockers: |
  No big blockers today, just making sure everything is integrated correctly and still runs smoothly with the new data.

reflection: |
  It’s kind of exciting to shape the model into something more personalized to the problem I’m trying to solve. There’s still a lot of testing 
  and tweaking ahead, but it feels like I’m making the project truly mine. Also still havent gotten the accracy over about 60% but hoping that 
  changes.
