  what_i_learned: |
    Today I kept working on my Rainbow DQN model and honestly, I’m still shocked that it’s performing consistently well, even after adding more  
    to it and switching to a new dataset. I made age a more dominant factor in the model, which seems to help, but I’m debating whether I should 
    remove some of the other features to prevent overfitting or noise. It’s all part of the tuning process. Outside of coding, we had a chance
    to play with some really cool neuro and muscle controlled devices! One responded to brain signals and the other to muscle movement it was 
    wild to see tech like that in action.

  blockers: |
    No major blockers today, just still figuring out which features are most helpful to keep in the model.

  reflection: |
    I’m feeling a lot more confident in the model now. It’s encouraging to see it hold up even with a new dataset and more complexity. I’m also
    having fun tweaking things to see how much more performance I can squeeze out of it. And the drone activity? Easily one of the coolest 
    things we’ve done this summer.
