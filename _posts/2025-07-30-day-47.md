  what_i_learned: |
    Today we finalized our presentation! We wrapped up all the slides and made sure everything flows clearly. We practiced a few times and made       small edits to tighten things up. Even though we were rushing a bit toward the end, I think we pulled it off well. 

  blockers: |
    Just time pressure, we were trying to get everything wrapped up smoothly and efficiently before the final day.

  reflection: |
    I’m not feeling too nervous anymore; I just hope we get to present a little earlier so we can relax afterward. It feels surreal to be at the 
    end. Despite the stress, it’s nice to see everything we worked on come together in one final moment.
