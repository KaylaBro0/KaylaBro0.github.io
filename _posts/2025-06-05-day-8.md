what_i_learned: |
 Since I was absent, I didn’t get to do much hands on work, but I still tried to stay involved by reading a few research papers related to Type 
 1 Diabetes. Most of what I read focused on recent advances in treatment options and the autoimmune aspects of T1D. It wasn’t the same as 
 being there, but I was still making some progress and staying engaged with the project.

blockers:
 The main blocker today was being absent, so I wasn’t able to participate fully.

reflection:
  Even though I wasn’t physically there, reading the research papers helped me stay in the updated. I’m looking forward to being back and 
  catching up on what I missed. It’s clear there’s a lot to learn, and I’m excited to get more involved with the group and more in person hands 
  on work .
