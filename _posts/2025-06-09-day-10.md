what_i_learned: |
    Today I read Scalable and Accurate Deep Learning with Electronic Health 
    Records*, and it explained how deep learning can be used to predict important 
    hospital outcomes like death, readmission, long stays, and diagnoses without 
    needing to manually clean or select data. They used FHIR to organize the raw 
    medical records into a timeline, turned everything into tokens, and trained a 
    model on over 216,000 hospital stays. The model made accurate predictions earlier 
    than traditional tools and reduced false alarms, which could really help doctors 
    save time and improve care.

  No blockers for today.

reflection: |
    This paper showed me how powerful deep learning can be when you let it learn from 
    the full story of a patient, not just a few features. I liked that they didnâ€™t 
    have to rebuild the model for every hospital or problem it was flexible and 
    scalable. It made me think about how we might structure our own data to make the 
    most out of what we have.
