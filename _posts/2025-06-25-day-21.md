what_i_learned: |
  Still deep in the code today. I spent most of the time trying to figure out what’s going wrong with the Rainbow DQN model.  
  The calculations seem off, some of the values I’m getting don’t make sense, and I’m even seeing negative numbers where I dont think there  
  shouldn’t be any.I double checked a few parts of the logic, but it looks like something deeper might be wrong, maybe in the reward 
  function or the way the q values are being calculated.

blockers: |
  The model still isn’t working. The outputs are off, and I’m getting negative numbers that break the expected behavior.  
  I need to trace through the math and check how the data is being processed.

reflection: |
  It’s frustrating to be stuck in the debugging phase, but I know this is part of working with complex models. Each issue I  
  run into teaches me more about how things are supposed to work. I’m hoping that with a bit more digging and maybe some  
  outside help, I’ll get closer to a fix soon.
