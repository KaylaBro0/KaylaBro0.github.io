what_i_learned: |
  Today marked the first day where we were in person. We started off with introductions and an overview of the program. It was very informative.
  It showed me what we will be doing as far as deliverables and presentations. We then did a workshop wich taught me suprisinglu=y a lot about 
  variables both dependent and indemendent variables. After that we went on to do a fi=un marshmello challenge wich was super fun and engaging. 
  We didnt win but we had a super strong base, ours was about 27 inches so it wasnt too bad. After kunch we talked about our goals long term and 
  short term and went on to discuss our pre work. We also took a look at some of the coding process that we will be doing in a few weeks.

  No blockers for today.


reflection: |
   I’m honestly really excited to get started with everything. Today gave me a much better idea of what we’ll be doing, and it made me look 
   forward to what’s coming next. The activities were actually super fun. I learned more than I expected in the workshop, and the marshmallow 
   challenge was such a good time, even though we didn’t win. It just feels like this is going to be a really good experience, and I’m excited 
   to learn new things, work with new people, and see how much I grow by the end of the program.
