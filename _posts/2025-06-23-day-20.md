what_i_learned: |
  Today i’m still working on getting the Rainbow DQN model up and running. I’m making small bits of progress each day,  
  which helps keep me motivated. I understand more of the theory and the components involved, like how the replay buffer,  
  dueling networks, and noisy layers work—but connecting everything in code is still a challenge.

blockers: |
  Still having trouble getting the model to actually run. I think I’m close, but there’s something off in how the pieces  
  are interacting. I’m planning to get feedback and try some debugging strategies next.

reflection: |
  Even though I’m not fully there yet, it feels good to be learning by doing. Rainbow DQN is definitely not easy,  
  but working through the tough parts is helping me understand reinforcement learning better. I'm determined to keep at it!
