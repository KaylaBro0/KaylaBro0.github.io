   what_i_learned: |
      Today was a tough day. I’ve been working hard on the Rainbow DQN model, but it’s actually doing worse than before. On top of that, I now  
      need to incorporate more comorbidities, which just adds more complexity. I’ve tried multiple adjustments and nothing is working the way I 
      want it to. I’m seriously considering starting over again.

   blockers: |
      Model performance is getting worse despite changes. I'm struggling with how to integrate new comorbidities properly, and it's overwhelming.

   reflection: |
     I’m honestly feeling really discouraged today. It’s hard to keep putting in time and effort when the results just keep going downhill. I 
     know this is part of the research process, but it’s frustrating to keep hitting roadblocks. I might need to step back, reframe the problem, 
     and reset with a cleaner approach if I want to make real progress.
