what_i_learned: |
  Today marked the beginning of my work. Even though I couldn't be there, I still tried to get the work done. I tried to get the website started up.


blockers: |
  Due to me being absent, it was kind of hard to catch up. I couldn't find any of the notes so I just tried to get what I could done or at least started.
  
reflection: |
 I still tried my best even with my circumstances.
