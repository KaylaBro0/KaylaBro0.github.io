  what_i_learned: |
    Today we filmed the video for our pitch, and honestly, it was a lot of fun. We made sure to include our personalities and a bit of humor so 
    it wasn’t just a boring video. It really helped us think about how to communicate our research clearly and in a way that people would 
    actually want to watch.

    No blockers today!

  reflection: |
    I loved how creative today felt. It was a nice break from the intense coding and technical work, but still tied to the heart of the project. 
    Filming the pitch gave us the chance to reflect on everything we’ve done and present it in a way that felt authentic and engaging. I'm proud 
    of how we balanced being informative and entertaining. It reminded me that communicating the research is just as important as doing it 
    itself.
