what_i_learned: |
  I pulled together everything I’ve done this week and present it in a way that made sense to others. 
  Putting the slides together helped me realize how much progress I’ve made. 
  I also got better at using visualizations to actually show what I found instead of just talking about it.

blockers: |
  No blockers for today.

reflection: |
  Today I presented everything I worked on this week, which felt really good. 
  It made me appreciate how much I’ve done in a short amount of time. 
  I also made a few extra visualizations to dig deeper into the data and highlight some things I didn’t before.
