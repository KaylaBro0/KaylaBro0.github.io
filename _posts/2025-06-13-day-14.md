what_i_learned: |
  Today we created a video summarizing our week—highlighting both our achievements and challenges. It was fun to reflect and put everything   
  together.We also started thinking about our project in more detail and came up with research questions that we could answer using our proofs.  
  That helped give us direction as we began working on our design document.Using the code we wrote yesterday, we started to brainstorm how we 
  could implement our findings and data into it—replacing the sample data with our own. It’s starting to feel like everything is coming together.

blockers: |
  No blockers today.

reflection: |
  The video recap helped me realize how much we’ve accomplished already. It’s also exciting to move from theory into actual implementation.  
  Starting to write the design doc made our ideas feel more real, and I’m looking forward to seeing how our research turns into working code.
