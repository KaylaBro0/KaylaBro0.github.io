  what_i_learned: |
    Today I ran experiments to assess how well my Rainbow DQN model performs across demographic subgroups like sex and age. The method involved
    stratifying the test data and evaluating fairness related metrics like average reward, glucose/BP time-in-range (TIR), and convergence
    rates.Results were promising overall no dangerous glucose events, and the model reached 75% convergence rate. Subgroup analysis revealed
    some disparities: for example, sex group '1' had slightly worse glucose and BP TIR than group '0'. Age-wise, the elderly group had the best 
    glucose control, while the middle aged group showed more struggle with glucose TIR. Despite these disparities, this test helped validate the
    model's generalizability and highlighted areas for future tuning. Super proud the model is holding up this well in the final stretch!

  blockers: |
    Nothing major today—just continued monitoring of subgroup fairness and trying to understand the causes of small disparities across age and   
    sex.

  reflection: |
    I’m feeling really proud of where the model is now, especially after how rough things were a few weeks ago. This was one of the most
    rewarding days because the evaluation gave me solid evidence that things are working. Also, I’m so happy this is the last week ready to
    finish strong and enjoy the rest of the summer!
