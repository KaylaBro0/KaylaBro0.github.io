  what_i_learned: |
    Today I focused mainly on working through the final presentation. We’re not finished with all the slides yet, but we’re making steady 
    progress and things are coming together. Practicing the delivery is helping me better understand how to explain the project clearly and with 
    confidence. It’s also making me reflect more deeply on everything I’ve learned over the past several weeks.

  blockers: |
    None today just pacing ourselves to get the slides polished and practiced before the final showcase.

  reflection: |
    I can’t believe it’s almost the end! It’s a little nerve wracking having to present soon. But I’m also excited to show what we’ve done. I   
    think we’ve all grown a lot. It’s also rewarding to look back at how far we’ve come.
