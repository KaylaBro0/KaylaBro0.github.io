what_i_learned: |
  Today was actually pretty fun. We played a few games—Jenga and Taboo. I surprisingly did really well in Taboo and scored a lot of points for  
  our team.  I did so well they asked me to go again at the end to help secure the lead. After Taboo, we played Jenga, but the other team won.  
  Both teams still got the prize: either leaving early or arriving late. After our games, we had an Overleaf workshop, which was pretty easy. 
  Then we went back to our labs, where we cleaned and normalized data. We also learned how to do more with tokens.

  No blockers today.

reflection: |
  I really enjoyed the mix of work and play today. The games brought everyone together and lightened the mood, which made the rest of the  
  day more productive. I'm starting to feel more confident with data cleaning and token manipulation it’s satisfying to see messy data  
  turn into something usable.
