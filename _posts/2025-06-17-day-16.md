what_i_learned: |
  Today we kept working on our model, but I ran into some challenges. I’m still trying to figure out how to actually implement the logic using 
  our dataset. It's one thing to understand the idea, but getting it to work in code is proving difficult. I spent a lot of time reading through 
  what we already have and thinking about how to connect the pieces, but I haven’t figured out the right structure yet.

blockers: |
  I’m not sure how to actually make the model work with the data. I have the concept, but I’m stuck on how to write it out in code and make it 
  run properly.

reflection: |
  Today was a little frustrating because I didn’t make as much progress as I hoped. But I know this is part of the process sometimes you just 
  hit a wall before things click. I’m planning to ask for help or look at examples tomorrow so I can get unblocked and keep moving forward.
