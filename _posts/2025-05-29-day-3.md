what_i_learned: |
  Today was a fun day. FIrst I learned about computer vision and how many everyday things use it. Like speed cameras, face id and more. I also learned how to use YOLO, it was very cool to see things in my photos be detected. After that we as in our projet mates, did a cool escape room game. It was a little challenging at first but then after like the third puzzle we solved things got a lot easier. We then went on to do more python practice. I learned how to read files and also did some practice.

blockers: |
  I had a little trouble with the exit problem, not because I didn't know how to do it but because I haven't touched what we were covering in a while.But then I got the hang of it.
  
reflection: |
  I am really proud of myself for getting all my work done as well as not giving up because of difficulty. I would like to continue working withe the computer vision honestly. Like i'd want to do something related to like music or even curl types.
