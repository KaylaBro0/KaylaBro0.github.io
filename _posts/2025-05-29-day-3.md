what_i_learned: |
  Today was a fun day. First, I learned about computer vision and how it's used in a lot of everyday things like speed cameras, Face ID, and 
  more. I also learned how to use YOLO, which was super cool—it was fun seeing things in my photos actually get detected. After that, my project 
  group and I did a cool escape room game. It was a little challenging at first, but after the third puzzle, things started to click and got 
  easier. Later on, we did more Python practice. I learned how to read files and got some solid practice in.

Blockers
  I had a little trouble with the exit problem—not because I didn’t know how to do it, but just because I haven’t touched that topic in a while. 
  Once I got back into the flow, it started to make sense again.

Reflection
  I’m really proud of myself for getting all my work done and not giving up, even when things were tough. I actually really enjoyed working with 
  computer vision and would love to keep exploring it. Honestly, I’d love to do something with it that connects to music—or even something like 
  detecting curl types. That would be super interesting to try out.
