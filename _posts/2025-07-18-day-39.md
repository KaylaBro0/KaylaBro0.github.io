  what_i_learned: |
    Today was another tough one. My Rainbow DQN model’s accuracy dropped even more, and I still haven’t been able to successfully incorporate 
    the other demographic features like age and gender. I’ve also been trying to find a better dataset that might help us move forward, but so 
    far, no luck.

  blockers: |
    Low accuracy with the model, and trouble finding a strong additional dataset to support our work. Still unsure how best to integrate 
    demographic data meaningfully into the model.

  reflection: |
    It’s frustrating to keep trying and not see much progress. I know this is part of research, but it’s still discouraging. I want to solve 
    these problems and contribute something meaningful, but right now it feels like I’m stuck. Still, I’m holding on to the idea that something 
    will click soon and I’ll keep pushing until it does.
