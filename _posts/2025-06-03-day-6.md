what_i_learned: |
  Today was a pretty hefty day. We cleaned up some data also did some checking for the different comorbities that we can possably focus on.
  We had to do a lot of searching today. We had to look up and really understand what each of the possible comorbities meant
  and how they related to our project. I also learned how important it is to understand the context behind the data. It’s not just about 
  organizing numbers, you really have to know what each variable means and why it matters. That helped us start thinking more critically about 
  which conditions are most relevant to focus on.
  
blockers: |
  No blockers for today.


reflection: |
   It was a bit overwhelming at first trying to understand all the different comorbidities, but it ended up being really informative. 
   Doing the research helped me better understand the scope of the project and why each condition matters. I’m starting to see how 
   the data connects to our project , which makes the work feel a little more meaningful. I'm excited to narrow down our focus and 
   start applying what we’ve learned to our analysis.
