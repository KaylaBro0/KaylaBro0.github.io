  what_i_learned: |
      Things are getting harder. We're supposed to start Project Two next week, and honestly, it feels way too late to be changing directions 
      like this. After putting in so much time and effort, it’s tough to feel like we're starting from scratch again.

  blockers: |
      Mentally overwhelmed. It’s hard to stay motivated knowing we're shifting so late in the process. I’m also still dealing with low model 
      performance from the first part.

  reflection: |
      I'm counting down the days at this point. It’s been a long and draining journey. I know these moments happen in research, but it doesn’t
      make it any easier. Still, I’m pushing through and trying to stay grounded in the fact that I’ve learned a lot even if things didn’t go 
      the way I thought they would. I really can’t wait to feel a sense of relief when it’s all over.
