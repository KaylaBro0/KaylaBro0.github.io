 what_i_learned: |
    Today was honestly a little frustrating. I was mostly working on my Rainbow DQN model again, but I'm still getting low values and not much 
    improvement.I know I’m supposed to be incorporating age and gender into the model now, but I’m not sure exactly how to go about doing that.I 
    feel kind of confused about my exact role in the new project pivot and what my specific deliverables should look like.

 blockers: |
    I'm confused about how to properly integrate demographic info like age and gender into my model. Also unclear about what my main goal is 
    right now in the pivot.

 reflection: |
    Some days feel a lot messier than others, and today was one of those days. I know confusion is part of the process, especially when pivoting 
    or refocusing a project, but it’s still frustrating to not have a clear direction. I’m going to try to talk with someone tomorrow to get 
    more clarity about where I stand and how to move forward. Even though my model isn’t performing well yet, I’m still trying and that counts.
