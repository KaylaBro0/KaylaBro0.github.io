what_i_learned: |
  Today we finished putting together our presentation for the mid-year symposium and spent time practicing it. It was helpful to run through 
  everything out loud and get feedback on pacing and clarity. Practicing made me realize where I still stumble a little, especially when I have 
  to explain my model in a simple way. But overall, it’s coming together, and I’m learning how to be more concise and confident when talking 
  about technical work.

  No blockers today.

reflection: |
  I’m feeling a little nervous about presenting, but I know that’s normal. I just need to keep practicing and reminding myself that I know this 
  project better than anyone else. I’ve put in the work, and this is just about sharing that journey. Hopefully with a little more prep, I’ll 
  feel more confident and ready to own it when it’s time to present.
