what_i_learned: |
  Today I restarted my entire model from scratch. I realized that the previous versions weren’t fully aligned with my research question, so I’m 
  going back to basics to rebuild with more intention. I’m trying to keep everything focused around how reinforcement learning can help with 
  optimizing medication strategies for T1D and hypertension, but translating that into working code is more challenging than expected. I spent 
  time reviewing my environment setup, refining the action and reward space, and thinking deeply about how to make the model actually reflect 
  real clinical goals.

blockers: |
  I’m having trouble figuring out how to bring my research question to life in the model. It’s hard to balance the medical context with what’s 
  technically possible right now in my implementation.

reflection: |
  It’s a little frustrating to feel like I’m starting over again, but I also know this is part of the process. Every time I’ve restarted, I’ve   
  gotten a little clearer on what I want the model to do and what’s realistic to expect from it. I just need to keep breaking the problem into 
  smaller pieces and not lose sight of the big picture.
