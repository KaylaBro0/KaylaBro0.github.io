what_i_learned: |
    Today was a long day. We started with watching an hour long MIT lecture on reinforcement learning, then answered some questions about our 
    findings. We then took a look at some of my old design docs to get a reference for the one we are going to create. It was really helpful to 
    see how my thinking has evolved over time especially noticing areas where I used to overcomplicate things, or where I didnâ€™t fully define 
    the problem. This gave me a better framework for approaching the new design doc with more clarity and structure. We then had a meeting with 
    our faculty mentor about our project question.

  No blockers for today.

reflection: |
    Iâ€™m starting to appreciate how important it is to slow down and think before diving into code. The lecture helped me see that sometimes  
    the math or theory behind something can feel overwhelming at first, but once you sit with it, it starts to click. 
    Meeting with my faculty mentor in the afternoon was super encouraging. We walked through my initial ideas for the new project and talked  
    about scope, feasibility, and potential impact. He gave great feedback and asked questions that helped sharpen my thinking. I left the 
    meeting feeling more confident about next steps.
