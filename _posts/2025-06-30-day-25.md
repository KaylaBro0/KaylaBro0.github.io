what_i_learned: |
  Today I had a bit of a reality check I realized that the way I’ve been building my Rainbow DQN model doesn’t actually align with my research 
  question. So... I have to start over and rebuild the model with that question in mind. It’s definitely frustrating, especially after putting 
  in so much work, but it’s also a valuable lesson. The model can’t just be technically functional it has to answer the right question. Now I’m 
  refocusing on how to design it properly to fit the problem I’m trying to solve.

blockers: |
  Basically, needing to start over is the blocker. Trying to figure out the right way to connect the model to my actual research goals.

reflection: |
  It’s not fun to feel like I’ve taken a step backward, but I know it’ll lead to better results in the end. I’m trying to stay positive and just 
  take it one step at a time. I *will* get it done.
