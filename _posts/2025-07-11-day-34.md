   what_i_learned: |
      Today we had another meeting with our faculty mentor where we went over the two project tracks and refined how we frame them. My project 
      is now under the name "FAIR-MED-RL," which focuses on creating a fairness aware reinforcement learning model to help optimize medication 
      strategies for diverse T1D and comorbidity cases. We reviewed the goals, including making sure our models work across underrepresented 
      groups and are explainable and clinically meaningful. We also looked at the beginning of our research paper and discussed how to connect 
      our research questions with the model development process. It’s starting to feel more official and structured now.


   blockers: |
      A little confused about moving forward.

   reflection: |
      Seeing the official project name and summary helped things feel more real. It gave our work more direction and made the goals feel a little clearer.
      It’s exciting to think that this might actually become a paper we submit to a real conference. Looking at the early outline of the paper also 
      reminded me how much technical work we’ve done so far and how much thought still has to go into telling that story in a clear, meaningful way.
      I’m starting to sort of understand how each part of the project from coding to model design to evaluation connects back to the big picture. 
      This meeting helped refocus me and gave me more motivation to keep refining my model and making sure it aligns with the goals of fairness, 
      accuracy, and impact. Even though I am a little confused about the pivot I will understand it more.
