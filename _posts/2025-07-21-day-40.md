   what_i_learned: |
       Today was a pretty chill but productive day. After the writing workshop, I spent some time working in Overleaf and started brainstorming 
      ideas for the upcoming project pitch. I really want ours to show our personality and not too serious but to also me informative. I want it 
      to resemble the older commercials from my childhood but we will see what we can do in a day. I’m still making tweaks to the Rainbow DQN, 
      especially around how I present and frame the data inputs.

   blockers: |
    No major blockers today, just small ongoing adjustments to the model.

   reflection: |
     It’s honestly wild that everything is almost over. I’m glad we’re reaching the finish line, but also a little sad that it’s ending. There’s 
     been a lot of growth through the frustration. Today felt like a calm before the final stretch, and I’m ready to end on a strong note.  
     Working on the pitch and seeing it all come together reminded me that even if the model isn’t perfect, I’ve learned so much. From data 
     cleaning to designing and debugging a complex reinforcement learning model, it’s been a serious journey. Just a few more steps to go.
