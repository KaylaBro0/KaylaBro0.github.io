what_i_learned: |
  Today I made more progress on my new Rainbow DQN model it’s almost complete! But I’m getting ridiculously low accuracy (like 10%), so 
  something isn’t quite right. I’m not sure what’s causing it yet, but I’m hoping to figure that out tomorrow. I also spent time reviewing my 
  model setup and reward logic to make sure everything is aligned with the research goals. We had a meeting with our faculty mentor, which 
  helped reframe how we need to be thinking about the overall research structure. We talked about how important it is to clearly connect our
  four research questions to our model development. The goal is to make sure that whatever we’re building is technically sound and clearly 
  answering the questions we’ve posed. It was a helpful reminder that our modeling work should be grounded in purpose, not just experimentation. 
  We also discussed adding a new comorbidity because our current cohort is too small, and that may mean adjusting our questions to fit the 
  updated data.

blockers: |
  My model is only hitting 10% accuracy, and I’m not sure what’s wrong. It’s hard to tell whether the issue is in the architecture, the reward 
  structure, or the way the data is being fed in.

reflection: |
  It’s a bit discouraging to see the model perform so poorly after restarting, but I know that debugging is part of the process. The mentor 
  meeting helped me refocus and reminded me that everything should tie back to the research questions. Tomorrow I’ll take another look at the 
  structure and try to pinpoint what’s going wrong. If I can get the accuracy up even a little, I’ll feel better. At least I’m learning a lot 
  every step of the way.
