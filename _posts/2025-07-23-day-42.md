  what_i_learned: |
    Today I spent most of my time working on my Rainbow DQN model. I’m finally starting to see real improvement! The model isn’t broken anymore, 
    and the accuracy is up to around 47%. Which even though it's not perfect, feels like a huge win after everything I’ve been through these 
    past few weeks with this model.

  blockers: |
    No major blockers today!

  reflection: |
    It feels so good to finally see the light at the end of the tunnel. I also started working with a kind of new dataset really just a cleaned 
    up and edited version to help make things a little more manageable.I'm proud of the progress I’ve made, especially after struggling for so 
    long. Today reminded me that even slow improvement is still growth, and I’m excited to keep pushing until the finish line.
