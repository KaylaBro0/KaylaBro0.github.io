what_i_learned: |
  Today we did a lot of design doc work—like, a lot. We finally finished our first version, which feels like a huge step forward.  
  Writing everything out really helped us think through the structure of our project, how our data fits in, and what steps we need to take next.   It was a long day of planning and technical writing, but it paid off.

blockers: |
  No blockers today.

reflection: |
  Finishing the first draft of the design doc made everything feel more real. Having a clear outline for our project makes the next steps  
  feel more manageable. I'm feeling more confident now that we’ve written things down and thought them through as a team.
