what_i_learned: |
  Today was a big code reading day but honestly, I didn‚Äôt mind it. We started things off by diving into some simulation code using the  
  simglucose library. It‚Äôs an environment that lets you simulate virtual patients with Type 1 diabetes. We looked at how you can register custom   patients and meal scenarios, then run the environment with randomized actions to see how the glucose levels respond over time. Super cool to 
  see how even a random controller can start to shape patient behavior.
  Then we explored a  custom built environment called  T1DHypertensionEnvironment. This one really caught my attention. It simulates both blood  
  glucose and blood pressure in a single environment. You can adjust insulin and BP meds separately, and it tracks their effects over time 
  including random fluctuations that mimic the body's natural behavior.
  The reward system was especially interesting, it penalizes both low and high glucose and low and high BP, so you‚Äôre constantly trying to 
  balance two systems without letting either one spiral. 
  
blockers: |
  No blockers today just lots of thinking and some good discussion.

reflection: |
  Today reminded me that there‚Äôs so much more to learning than just writing code. Reading someone else's logic, figuring out their modeling 
  choices, and thinking critically about trade offs is where I really get a deeper understanding.Also we had a little team convo / bonding 
  excercise we had after the deep dive. After that I was inspired to try building or tweaking my own environment soon.
