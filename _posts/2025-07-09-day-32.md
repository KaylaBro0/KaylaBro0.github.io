 what_i_learned: |
  Today we talked about spliting our project into two parts based on the research questions. My focus is now on Project 2, which is about 
  optimizing medication strategies for T1D and another comorbidity using reinforcement learning, while also ensuring fairness and 
  generalizability. We created a step by step plan covering everything from literature review to model development and evaluation. This helped 
  clarify how each model and decision needs to directly connect back to our research questions. We also discussed adding another comorbidity due 
  to our current cohort size.

 blockers: |
  No major blockers today just a lot of information to process and plan around.

 reflection: |
  I feel more focused now that my role is clearly defined. The structure we outlined today makes the project feel more manageable, and I’m 
  excited to keep building from here.
