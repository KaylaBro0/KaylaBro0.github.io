what_i_learned: |
  Today we started with a fun ship survival game where we had to rank a list of items from most to least important for survival.  
  It was a great way to spark discussion and teamwork. After that, we practiced giving a 30-second pitch for our project to help  
  onboard a new member—who's a teacher—so they could quickly understand what we’re working on. In the afternoon, we went back to our labs and 
  continued coding. I focused on working with the Rainbow DQN model. It’s a bit complex,  
  but I’m slowly starting to understand how all the parts fit together.

blockers: |
  No major blockers today—just trying to understand all the moving parts of the Rainbow DQN.

reflection: |
  I liked today’s mix of teamwork and technical work. The survival game helped us communicate better, and the pitch practice reminded me  
  how important it is to be able to explain our work clearly. I’m feeling more confident as I keep working through the model.
