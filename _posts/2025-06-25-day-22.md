what_i_learned: |
  Today was a huge win, I finally got the Rainbow DQN model to run! After days of debugging and trying to figure out what was  
  going wrong, it’s finally working. It feels so good to hit this milestone. Right now, the model’s accuracy is around 42–50%, so I know there’s 
  still room to improve. I’ll be focusing next on tweaking the parameters and figuring out how to boost performance.

blockers: |
  No blockers today, just working on improving accuracy now that the model runs.

reflection: |
  It was hard getting to this point, but definatly worth it. Seeing it actually work made all the struggle feel meaningful.  
  I know there’s still more to do, but this was a big step and I’m proud of the progress.
