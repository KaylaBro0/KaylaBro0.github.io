what_i_learned: |
  Today was mostly focused on prepping for the mid year symposium. I worked on putting together slides that highlight my contributions, 
  challenges, and technical progress so far. It made me reflect on how much I've done, even when things were frustrating or needed to be
  restarted. Turning that work into a clean and cohesive presentation took some time, but it helped me organize my thoughts and understand my 
  own growth. I also practiced how I might explain my project to someone who isn’t technical, which helped me think differently about how to 
  communicate what I’m doing. It’s cool to see how everything is starting to connect and take shape.

  No blockers today.

reflection: |
  It was actually kind of rewarding to go back and look at everything I’ve done so far. Sometimes it feels like I’m not moving fast enough, but 
  looking back showed me how much I’ve learned and how far I’ve come. I’m excited (and a little nervous) to present, but I’m proud of the work 
  that’s getting showcased. This process reminded me that progress doesn’t always look like working code—sometimes it’s about the mindset shifts 
  and persistence too.
