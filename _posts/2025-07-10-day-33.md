  what_i_learned: |
    Today we had a writing workshop that helped us frame our research more clearly. I drafted some opening lines and a problem statement for my 
    project, focusing on how RL can support people with T1D and other comorbidities. It made me think more deeply about how to communicate the
    importance of my work.I also worked on summarizing my methodology and expected findings. I’m aiming to build an RL model that recommends 
    medication strategies using biochemical and demographic data. The workshop gave me new ways to think about clarity and impact in scientific 
    writing.

    No blockers today.

  reflection: |
    It felt good to step back and put my project into words. Writing everything out helped me better understand what I’ve done and where I’m 
    going next. It also reminded me why this research matters, especially for people managing complex conditions like T1D.Sometimes when you're 
    deep in coding or data, it's easy to forget the human side of the work.
