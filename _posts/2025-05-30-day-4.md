what_i_learned: |
  Today we did a survey, then moved on to working with Python. I learned how to do more with files, like looping through them, using 
  dictionaries with data, and even checking for a word in a file. We practiced these concepts and then did two labs. We were supposed to 
  finish in about 15 minutes, but it took me a little longer since I haven’t worked with this in a while.

blockers: |
  I had a little trouble finishing within the time we were given, but it came together in the end.
 
reflection: |
 These reviews are really helpful for me. Even though I don’t work very well in fast-paced environments, I still did pretty well. I feel like
 I’m getting more comfortable with reading from and writing to files, and I’m starting to see how powerful dictionaries are for organizing 
  data. I’m also realizing how much I need to practice thinking about the overall structure of my code before I jump in—this helps me go faster 
  and feel less stressed. Overall, I feel more confident and excited to keep learning.
