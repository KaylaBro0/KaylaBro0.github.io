what_i_learned: |
  Today we started with a survey, then moved on to working with Python. I learned how to do more with files, like looping through them, using 
  dictionaries with data, and checking for a specific word in a file. We practiced those concepts and did two labs. We were supposed to finish 
  in about 15 minutes, but it took me a bit longer since I haven’t done this kind of stuff in a while.
  After that, we had a workshop on AI and LLMs. We talked about how computers are learning and generating things. I made a Frank Ocean-type song 
  using AI—it wasn’t good at all, but it was kind of funny to see what it came up with. I also used an app to create an AI that I could talk to.

  We wrapped up with a Kahoot to help us understand more about generative AI and LLMs. One of the activities was guessing if something was real 
  or fake, which was harder than I thought. Overall, it was a cool mix of learning and hands-on stuff.

  I had a little trouble finishing within the time we were given, but it came together in the end.
 
reflection: |
 These reviews are really helpful for me. Even though I don’t work very well in fast-paced environments, I still did pretty well. I feel like
 I’m getting more comfortable with reading from and writing to files, and I’m starting to see how powerful dictionaries are for organizing 
  data. I’m also realizing how much I need to practice thinking about the overall structure of my code before I jump in—this helps me go faster 
  and feel less stressed. Overall, I feel more confident and excited to keep learning.
