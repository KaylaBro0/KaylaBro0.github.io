subtitle: AI-Driven Comorbidity Management in Type 1 Diabetes
project_title: "AI-Driven Comorbidity Management in Type 1 Diabetes: A Reinforcement Learning Approach for Thyroid, Celiac, and Cardiovascular 
 Disorders"

problem: |
  People with Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) face a higher risk of developing cardiovascular diseases like heart attacks and strokes. Over time, high 
  blood sugar levels can damage the heart and blood vessels, leading to complications. However, managing diabetes involves a lot of decisions— 
  like adjusting insulin doses, tracking blood sugar, and more. This can be tricky because every person’s body is different, and their health 
  changes over time.

approach: |
  To use Deep Q-Networks (DQN), a type of artificial intelligence, to create personalized treatment plans for people with Type 1 Diabetes. The 
  AI learns from each patient’s health data—like blood sugar levels, insulin use, heart health, and physical activity—and uses that information 
  to suggest tailored strategies. Unlike traditional methods, the DQN adapts over time, improving its recommendations as it receives new data. 
  This personalized, data-driven system aims to help patients manage their diabetes more effectively and reduce their risk of cardiovascular 
  events.

outcome: |
  This project will produce a personalized AI system that helps manage cardiovascular risk in Type 1 Diabetes patients. Key outcomes include-
  
   - A trained Deep Q-Network (DQN) that makes tailored treatment recommendations.
     
   -A cleaned and analyzed dataset ready for AI use.
   
   -A simulated environment to test treatment strategies.
   
   -A report and presentation showing how well the AI reduces cardiovascular risk.
   
  These results will show the potential of AI to improve personalized care and long-term health outcomes.
