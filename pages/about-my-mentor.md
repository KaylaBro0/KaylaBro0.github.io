  bio: |
    Ricky Gole is a dedicated Master’s student in Advanced Computing at Morgan State University, joining our project this summer. He brings 
    strong skills in reinforcement learning, cloud security, and data science, with a keen interest in applying Deep Q-Networks to healthcare. 
    Ricky is reliable and always willing to help out, committed to being on campus and fully engaged. I’m confident he’ll be a 
    valuable and supportive team member.

  bio: |
    Dr. Jamell Dacon is a Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Morgan State and the Director of the MINDS Lab. He’s not just an expert in 
    AI, machine learning, and data science he uses his research to tackle real-world problems, especially where tech and society intersect. On 
    top of all that, he’s contributed to some of the top conferences and journals in the field, which just shows how respected he is in the 
    academic world.
    But what really makes Dr. Dacon different is the way he makes every student feel like they matter. He genuinely believes in us and makes you 
    feel like you can accomplish anything if you’re willing to put in the work. He gives us the space and support to chase big dreams and helps 
    us see our potential even when we can’t. Like the Malcolm Forbes quote says, “Education’s purpose is to replace an empty mind with an open 
    one,” and Dr. Dacon lives that every day.
